    title: 'Photography? Why?',

    intro: ["Concepts, Experiments, Gaps, Illusion, Playfulness & Hyper-Sensation.", "Humor and possibilities born in a “Perfect” Mastered Digital Era.", "The greatest japanese contemporary photographers."],

    presentation: [
        "I met the five photographers (except Yuki Onodera) in Aix-en-Provence in 2015 when we were  invited to exhibit at “Regards Croisés Japon-Provence/Photo Aix 2015” at Galerie Zola de la Cité du Livre. We spent a week together, every day discussing the lighting and hanging in the exhibition space, photography, our own work (from creation, conception and materials to technique and distribution), other people’’s work, the contemporary era, our preoccupations, and ourselves. We are all aged from 40 to 56 years old, albeit belonging to different generations.", 

        "Typically, in festivals or exhibitions, people meet and then move on as soon as the event ends, but our meetings and conversations have continued up to the present day. We get together and enjoy speaking with each other as photographers, artists and as people. As Ken Kitano says, artists cannot create alone, but are supported by many people”. Our meetings are like a casual study group, where we inspire each other and think further about photography.",
        
        "The works of these six artists are representative of my own questioning with regard to photography: Photography? Why? The essential question arising is: what is the potential of photography in today's world, with today's perceptions? It seems to me important that the artist’s’ work be shared with the public, especially in Morocco, where the link with Japan is historically rather tenuous. The two countries remain shrouded in mystery for each other. My aim is to present their work as “potentialities of contemporary photography“, rather than to enclose them within some definition of “Japanese photography“ that would segment them, prejudging their potential and the diversity of their practices.",
        
        "Their works are extremely different from each other, with the exception of one common aspect: we are faced here with the current context of photography, in the digital age, which can be seen as tending to produce personal, figurative, and technically perfect photographs. Such rapid evolution in photography has not yet sufficiently encouraged exploration of the relationship between conception, theme and exhibition of work during the creative process. Photography has arguably become a support based on the expectations of the viewers, as if it were the artist’’s role to realize the language of photography as expected. This vision would tend to preclude the need of photographers to experiment and to question the relationship between medium and technique, as if the nature of visual perception could be taken for granted.",
        
        "Nowadays, we largely produce images in what may be termed a dematerialized, “capitalist“ way, without considering the materiality of the works. Many exhibitions are made possible by simply sending a digital file, without any consideration being given to the notion of an original image. This could in a way be seen as a democratization of photography — and yet such an approach amounts to a limitation of the idea of photography and the possibilities of its materiality.",
        
        "In Japanese photography, we are frequently faced with street snapshots, considered mainstream. These are easy to view, essentially amounting to a representation within the frame (comprising composition and tone), and often sensational. This tradition presents almost no challenges to possibilities in photographic technique. It is a photographic approach that can be said most often to provide the viewer with a description rather than a question. It is moreover an approach that has also been repeated so often that it has become a standardized language. ",
        
        "Since 2011, the 'Fukushima rush hour' has burgeoned, with photographers flocking to shoot Fukushima after the nuclear disaster, seeking to show how tragic it is for people to have lost everything, as if there were only one voice in this context. Such a trend is fine on first viewing, but after repeatedly seeing the same perspective, viewers are left feeling as if looking into an empty nutshell.",
        
        "The photographers I have chosen to present at the Marrakech festival are independent artists, quite removed from what is commonly recognized as “Japanese photography“, and their way of operating is equally autonomous. Although not part of mainstream “Japanese photography“, they are nonetheless successful. They are now known for their specific approach to photography, through which they continue to question their potentialities and the notions that we hold of them — indeed, such questioning can be seen as the very basis of their work. They do not stop experimenting with their medium.",

            quote: "«I want to photograph the world as it is rather than how I see it. This is different from 'photographing for photography', which more or less means 'I photographed this way'. By adopting this principle of photographing the world as it is, we probably have the impression of feeling the world we 'missed'. My work is not proof of my having been there and this does not concern anyone. What matters is that the viewer wonders whether this landscape still exists where it was photographed.»",

            bio: ["1963 Born in Shingu, Wakayama Prefecture. 1987 Graduated from Tokyo College of Photography, Research Department. Professor at Tokyo Art University Faculty of Fine Arts, Advanced Art Expression. He started his creative activities using the medium of photography in the late 1980s. He published his first photo book, Kumano, devoted to his hometown (Kumano) in 1998. The following year, he brought out Piles of Time and the photographs of Osorezan. In 2000, he received the 25th Kimura Ihei Award for his narrative exhibition, in which the path to the healthy place is photographed like in a road movie, in the manner of continuous photography. He has exhibited outside of Japan, in New York in 2006 and in Zurich in 2011 and 2018."],

            text: "Risaku Suzuki is one of the most highly renowned of contemporary Japanese photographers. He likes to play with the ordinary, to which he gives value. In the series entitled Pile of Time, he presents photographs of the Osorezan (mountain of fear) in Aomori, a subject previously covered by photographers such as Issei Suda and Shomei Tomatsu, whose work focusses on the dark side of this location, where the paths of life and death are crossed. Suzuki, on the other hand, has shot a bright mix of images in a style that is sometimes referred to as “pop“. He does not claim to have an individual photographic style, but rather explores the experience developed between his photographs and the viewer. He questions visual perception and wonders how viewers already know what images can represent. He travels extensively, with his large format, complex and heavy view camera. Curiously, his works are colorful and light, quite the contrary of his equipment. In everyday life, he plays constantly with cameras, switching with ease from the large format camera to the mobile phone. He prefers to avoid precise composition, as if teasing the viewer, who may come to wonder “why did he photograph this space where there is nothing special to see?‘ He wants his work to be questioned, challenging the viewer, underlining how visual perception is often misleading and illusory. In the series entitled White, he puts white sheets of paper next to photographs of snow. The viewer, who does not initially grasp the difference, is gradually led to the experience of looking at the photo of the snow. Suzuki also adheres to the principle of the importance for photography to integrate the particularities of the photographed place. His work deals with an aesthetically soothing and recognizable beauty that is nevertheless uncomfortable for the conscious mind. His subjects can be considered Japanese clichés, though the Sakura (cherry blossom) is not represented. In some photographs, there is no visible point of focus, leading to abstraction, or else focused and unfocused figures seem to be misplaced. The work may be liked or disliked, but more often than not this provokes a reaction of being tugged to and fro, as with a painting to which the viewer is repeatedly drawn without knowing why. Suzuki's photographs can be contemplated for long moments. His work is largely developed in the form of frequently interlinked series.",

Even if it was hard, even if it was inelegant, they lived this survival with a big laugh. We are now living in the era that the generation before us built after the Second World War. Even though we are in a recession, we live in a society where apparently nothing is lacking. Nonetheless, in fact, something is lacking. I wonder if it is acceptable to live a 'possible' life rather than a 'full' life. It was for this reason that I thought of creating a fictional world through photography.

Showa 92 was nominated for the 41st Kimura Ihei Award. In 2015 his first film, Dalai Lama XIV, was released, having been shot in close-up over six years. It has been shown throughout Japan, starting with Shibuya Eurospace."],

            text:"Kazuyoshi Usui's work intentionally recreates imperfect frames. It mixes elements whose coexistence seems impossible. The viewer wonders whether the image represents reality or some staged scene. He creates tragicomic, illusory fictions that seem like narratives but are more like legends in which the viewer can choose to create the story that develops in the interstices between the photographs. Usui originally wanted to become a filmmaker but turned to photography as soon as he started practicing it. His first documentary was about the 14th Dalai Lama and was initially inspired by the Tibetan independence movement, of which Adam Yauch (a member of the Beastie Boys) was then a spokesman. His Showa trilogy, which he has been working on for nearly 20 years, is based on places that have kept some “whiff“ of the Showa era, in which he grew up, but are now disappearing. Usui does not work on memory, but imagines Showa as if the era had continued to the present. He depicts places typical of those to be found in underground or B movies, as well as the marginal people who live there in reality, in their minds or in the photographer's imagination. Usui was inspired by the Japanese painters Kiyokata Kaburagi and Settai Komura for their use of color, as well as by the cinematography by Kazuo Miyazawa (who filmed Rashomon of Kurosawa, winner of the Cannes film festival in 1951) and director John Waters. The “beauty of the extremes“ (Taikyoku no bi) also permeates the Showa trilogy. The sublime and the strange, terror and humor, oriental and western, life and death, the front and the back feed these clichés. Usui studied with the pioneering photographer Hosoe Eiko. The influence of the latter is visible in his black and white photographic work, such as Macaroni Christian.",

            text: "Haptic Green, by Naruki Oshima, is a series based on an extremely precise photographic process, close in some respects to scanning. The image is made up of numerous frames that are combined to compose a single final image — an end result that implies an underlying long work process. When the “overall“ photograph is complete, everything is illuminated, thanks to the time spent on constructing the image. Oshima uses the specifics of the digital camera to achieve an effect comparable to one obtained using a scanner. Owing to their wealth of detail, it is impossible to appreciate his photography on a computer screen. Careful attention is required to appreciate the beauty of his images, highly complex work that creates the experience of walking in a natural landscape, which no single-frame photograph could achieve. Naruki Oshima's photographs give rise to an exceptional form of perception that can only be experienced through his photographic approach. There are multiple sharp and blurred zones in a photograph by Oshima. The assembly of these frames into a single image is made possible through the combination of digital technology and a long, painstaking process. Like his compatriot, Risaku Suzuki, Oshima works in reference to other artists, notably Cézanne, whose motif Montagne Sainte-Victoire he has also photographed. Initially an engraver, he subsequently chose photography as a medium and uses the particular qualities of cameras and their precision. Figures, another series by Oshima, uses the same technique as Haptic Green, but the treatment of the subject is quite different, being no longer concerned with description, but focused on the experience of observing who takes precedence in the sensory encounter with an individual, as opposed to a portrait of the individual. Oshima studied photography at the academy of Düsseldorf with Thomas Ruff.",

It was important to break contours and limits, and my attempts were bold. The portrait came just to settle in the prints. I found it quite scary, but most beautiful.

            text: "Ken Kitano photographed 5,134 people in 14 years, traveling across Asia for the project entitled Our Face. He started this project after the Kobe earthquake, the Tokyo metro gas attack by Aum Shirikyo, and other acts of terrorism and war around the world. He could not imagine integrating these events into his own concerns, and this disturbed him. Consequently, he started visiting different places and photographing people, superimposing his own portrait to create an interconnection, the idea of “us“. In this age of globalization, there are still cultural groups that are specific to each place. His aim in creating this series was to convey the links between individuals and the human communities that transcend them. In each of his creations, he sets himself a huge challenge. In the case of Our Face, this involved producing an analogue print of over 3 meters in height, consisting of the superimposed portraits of numerous individuals, including baseball players, Buddhist monks, and high school students, among others. Kitano thus questions the relationship between the individual and the community at a time when, although less importance is attached to groups and the notion of belonging, being part of a community remains essential to our existence because we are all connected, despite our differences. Kitano has achieved international renown through this work. He has exhibited extensively in Japan and the United States. For his Gathering Light project, he set up his camera for six months in different parts of Japan to photograph the sun over the period between the change of seasons, beginning or ending at either the solstice or equinox. His unique consciousness of time is reflected in his works. Kitano's questions relate to our existence as human beings and our relationship to nature, the earth and the cosmos, including the representation of motion in still images, people in relation to geography, and the evolution of nature. In other words, his work records the movement of life as recorded on negative photographs and films, while always remaining attentive to the process control, accidents and surprises. His current work, focussing on babies, consists of large photograms formed by babies crawling on huge sheets of light-sensitive paper.",

It has also been featured in Foam magazine, the British Journal of Photography and the IMA magazine. His book, Photograph, was nominated for the Aperture / Paris Photo first photo book prize in 2014."],

            text: "Yuji Hamada has studied the history of photography (and is the author of a thesis on American photographer Robert Adams). His encyclopedic knowledge of the work of other photographers has led him to question the basic elements of photography, such as light, color, and printing, as in his series RGB and C/M/Y. His main concern is rendering invisible things — such as light — visible. Hamada is involved in a type of photography that is rare among his generation, working with films that have disappeared since the end of the 1990s and developing and printing most of his works himself, whether in color or in black and white. He mixes chemicals and is interested in the development and printing process and its potential. What is also remarkable in his work is its playful aspect, which encourages the viewer to look more attentively. Even though his work is meticulous, Hamada has an open mind and flexibility that allows him to listen, dialogue and reflect on his own photography. For the viewer, it is difficult not to be captivated by his works, which have a sustained aesthetic and enable a wider access to a refined, precise world, stimulating the imagination even beyond the intentions of the artist. Hamada accompanies the film in its analogous qualities. He lets these qualities appear without forcing them — qualities that contribute to his colorful, playful world. One of his central themes is the relationship between visible and invisible. In another series, Primal Mountain, he created an aluminum mountain sculpture alongside a photograph under natural lighting on his balcony. The idea behind this series came from a postcard he received from a friend living in Switzerland, just after the Fukushima disaster in 2011. The aluminum mountain he made represents the nuclear power plant that looks like a real mountain but is not. Thus he addresses the question of how to represent a nuclear disaster. Such representation may be considered almost impossible except by photographing empty fields and other such scenes of abandonment, that is, of elements that we do not see. Hamada presented an installation of this series in Vevey, Switzerland, with the photographs being shown on the lake, representing the disintegration of power plants and nuclear waste rejected into the sea. Hamada's photography is rich in qualities that are sorely missed in a world of photography where renewal is too rapid, one in which personal thought, choice of technique and presentation are too often sacrificed as secondary to the theme.",

Is this action not a very strange experience? Seeking to recreate this first sensation of ‘strangeness’ is one of the reasons why I remain faithful to photography.»",

            bio: ["Yuki Onodera was born 1962 in Tokyo. In 1993, she established a studio in Paris and began to work internationally. Onodera’’s experimental work, which does not fit within traditional schemas of ‘photography often explores two questions, namely what photography is and what can be achieved through it. She uses all possible means to create her works, whether taking photographs with a marble inside her camera, or creating a story out of a legend and traveling to the ends of the earth to shoot it. Onodera is known for making two-meter-high prints in the darkroom, painting on her photographs, and other original hands-on methods. Her work is held in collections around the world, including those of the Centre Georges Pompidou, San Francisco Museum of Modern Art, the J. Paul Getty Museum, Shanghai Art Museum and the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography. Solo exhibitions of her work include those presented at the National Museum of Art, Osaka (2005), Shanghai Art Museum (2006), the Tokyo Metropolitan Museum of Photography (2010), the Museum of Photography, Seoul (2010) and Musée Nicéphore Niépce, France (2011)."],

            text: "The work of Yuki Onodera displays undeniable photographic finesse and a creatively inventive technique. Her works are playful and imaginative. She is one of the most widely known Japanese photographers in the world. She seeks challenges that could only exist in photography and her series often float without any apparent constraint of gravity, while also exploring the concept of motion in stillness. Roma-Roma (Sweden, Spain) is based on two cities named Roma, which she photographed randomly with a twin-lens camera and subsequently hand painted the resulting prints in the manner of early color postcards. Below Orpheus (Spain, New Zealand) is a fictional crime series based around the disappearance of a person in a hotel in Madrid and posing the hypothesis of this person being found on the precise opposite side of the world, in New Zealand. Onodera works with various cameras and processes from one series to the next.There is extreme beauty in the large gelatin fiber prints she makes with her partner, achieving a level of perfection that has become rare. Onodera lives in France, where her first known series was Portrait of Secondhand Clothes, using items acquired from the exhibition Dispersion by Christian Boltanski (1993). She photographed each garment on her balcony in Montmartre. In How to Make a Pearl, she placed glass beads in a camera and photographed people on the street. The marbles create dark shadows and give the impression of people's bodies being engulfed by the white presence of the “pearl“. For this series, Onodera developed the film to enlarge the grain so that it resembles the close-up of the pearl, giving the impression of the prints being cracked and the characters being in volume. In many of her works, objects seem to float, as opposed to being clearly shot and anchored in compound photos. Transvest and Annular Eclipse comprises cutouts, magazine-mounted photos and backlit photographs. Inside each body can be found lampposts, historic buildings and microscopic images of the world. Transvest presents prints almost two meters tall, close to life size, and all printed by the artist. Last but not least, Eleventh Finger is a series in which she photographed people in the street with a hidden camera, without looking in the viewfinder. She then created a photogram and placed it in front of each photographed face, according to the subject’s unconscious physical movements. The 11th finger is her own finger. Yuki Onodera's works are technically rich and playful, using the photographic medium in a provocative way. It is clear that her work is based around themes, but she does not seek to focus on these and impose them as the pivot of her work, preferring to give the viewer the opportunity to experience seeing through these photographic works.",
